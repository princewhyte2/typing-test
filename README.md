This is a next js App

Installing dependencies using your package manager of choice (npm, yarn, etc.)
i'm using pnpm

To start the app, run the following command:
pnpm start

Since this is a demo project I chose to use several packages that I found useful so as to demonstrate technical knowledge.
    Zustand: For global state management
    Framer Motion: For animations
    TailwindCSS: For styling
    Lottie: For animations
    Cypress: For testing

To test the app, run the following command:
pnpm run test

While testing please ensure you select the end to end testing option and app is running.
